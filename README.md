This project is an implementation response to a project exam assignment at Noroff, for front-end development students. A brief of the assignment (from Noroff) describing the web app can be found below.

## Description

This is an accommodation booking site called Holidaze. I have worked with the official API documentation, and planned, designed, and built a modern front-end accommodation booking application.

There are two aspects to this application: the customer-facing side of the website where users can book holidays at a venue, and the admin-facing side of the website where users can register and manage venues and bookings at those venues.

The website has the following pages:

- A registered user may log in & logout
- A registered user may update their avatar
- A user may view a list of Venues
- A user may search for a specific Venue
- A user may view a specific Venue page by id
- A user may view a calendar with available dates for a Venue
- A user with a stud.noroff.no email may register as a customer
- A registered customer may create a booking at a Venue
- A registered customer may view (and delete) their upcoming bookings
- A user with a stud.noroff.no email may register as a Venue manager
- A registered Venue manager may create a Venue</li>
- A registered Venue manager may update&delete a Venue they manage
- A registered Venue manager may view bookings for a Venue they manage
